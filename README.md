# Express Server
> Uses an Express framework to build a simple server to serve an entire directory and some data for an application.

This was my fifth project at Origin Code Academy. This server was created using NodeJS, Express, and morgan.

## Approach

This app demonstrates running a server using NodeJS with the Express framework. The middleware used for this app was [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan). Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.

## Installation

Download all associated files and load them up in your favorite text editor!

## Development setup

This app relies on NodeJS, Express, and morgan for its functionality.

I recommend using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to run this server.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
// cd to-your-web-folder
nodemon server
```
